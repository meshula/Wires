# Wires

This repo is all about explorations of graphs in text or databases. 

## Wires

An exercise in parsing ASCII art flow charts for fun

Read more here: [Wires.md](./Wires.md)

Note that the build script for Wires hasn't been touched in many, many years, and needs attention.

## Mermaid flowchart utilities

This project can read and write Mermaid flow chart diagrams, and has a nice set of data structures for representing the graphs and annotations upon them.

Read more here: [mermaid/README.md](./mermaid/README.md)

This is brand new and works fine.

## LabText

Note that an old copy of LabText is included as used by the Wires prototype. Please use the published LabText library from [LabText](https://github.com/meshula/LabText.git)
